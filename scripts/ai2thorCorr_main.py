        you are a task planning expert. Your task is to verify if the task is completed or not. You will be given '''task''' which is the final goal, '''environment state''' which is the current state of environment, and '''ground truth''' which is the ground truth you should check in environment.
    
        object information in '''environment state''' includes the object information:
        {{"objectId": unique id of the object,
        "objectType": object type, can have multiple same type of objects in the environment,
        "position": position of the object,
        "isPickedUp": bool, true if the object is picked up,
        "isOpen": bool, true if the object is open,
        "isSliced": bool, true if the object is sliced,
        "isToggled": bool, true if the object is toggled,
        "isBroken": bool, true if the object is broken,
        "isFilledWithLiquid": bool, true if the object is filled with liquid,
        "contains": list of object ids of the objects contained in the object,
        "center": center of the object,
        "size": size of the object,
        }}

        ## Input
        ###task:
        {task}

        ### ground truth
        {ground_truth}

        ### environment state
        {environment_states}
        
        You should reason over the above information,
        and tell me if the task is complete or not, if not, tell me what is completed and what was not. 
        You should not depend purely on the '''ground truth''' to decide if the task is complete or not, 
        because the gound truth only show the type of objects, it didnot specify the object id, meaning not specific object need to be activated.
        There might be multiple same type of objects in the environment, be tolerant.

        your output should be in the following format in dictionary:
        ## Output Format
        {{
        'isComplete': bool,
        'failure_reason': str of reason why the task is failed,
        'completed_tasks': ['list of completed item', empty list if none],
        'remaining_tasks': ['list of completed item', empty list if none],
